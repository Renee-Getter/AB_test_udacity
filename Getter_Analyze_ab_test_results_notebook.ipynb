ESRI supplies GIS mapping and spatial analytics software, so they provide easy to understand documentation to help their customers understand the analytics and statistics you might see in their products. While the application is different, the basic description of the p-value and z-score were still accurate and useful to my learning.\n",

So, my results of -1.31 for a z-score indicated that the result were within 1.31 times the standard deviation, which, like the p-value results, would not allow you to reject the null hypothesis. The article included a table for typical alpha values and for 5%, you would want the z-score to fall outside of the -1.96 to 1.96 range in order to reject the null.

A good way to test to see if more than one factor influences is do multiple linear regressions with additional variables and evaluate the results. You must be mindfult that there can be problems with multiple linear regression, such as correlated errors or multicollinearity (when more than one independent variable are correlated to each other). There are ways to avoid or check for these errors. For example, if you suspect multicollinearity, you can plotting the independent variables or calculate the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) for each variable and see if any are greater than 10. "
